# jdbcproject
Project that implements different basic uses of jdbc. Login system, Session store, db update, and more.

For this project, you will need to create your own DB and edit the properties in the properties file (src/props). I have used 3 tables so far: user, session_log, inventory.

This project works with PostgreSQL. If you want to run it, you also have to change the path of the properties file in the code.


## Simple Project
### Car Dealership Interface

Uses Java Swing as UI and simple login system. Saves the data of whoever is logged in and lets the user do various things. The project is WIP, I plan to add small stuff to it.
It will be able to save appointments and manage them, as well as other features for managing the inventory.
